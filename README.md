# 2D animated desktop pet

## Motivation

Out of thin air.

## Goals

Get it running, just for fun, not actually recommended.

## Summary

2D animation that remains ot top of every other open window.
It requires a DE.
Simple animations, like checking for the mouse o just randomly doing something.
Not a pet, the idea is just to have it hovering the windows, period, no feeding, no walking, etc.
